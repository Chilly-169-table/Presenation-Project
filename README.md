- What was your experience?

This was created as part of my Front-End Learning Journey, specifically while making this website I learnt KeyFrame Animations and Transistions.
Animation and @keyframe lets you define, let's say for a certain number of properties the default values defined can be changed which is what leads to the Animation effect where-in Transistion property helps you a transisition occcurs i.e when there is a change in values of properties from one-value to another which can be achieved using pseudo-selectors it defines how these change occcurs but not what change occurs.
also setting overflow property of certain container-box to none will make sure the content just inside the container takes up the whole page.

- What have you learned/improved?
